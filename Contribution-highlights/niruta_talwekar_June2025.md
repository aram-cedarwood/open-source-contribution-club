# My Journey with Open Source: Joining OSCC to Make an Impact

Open source has always fascinated me—not just as a technical playground, but as a community where collaboration, mentorship, and shared passion come together to create lasting impact. For many years, I aspired to contribute actively to this world, but other priorities often stood in the way. That changed when I discovered the **Open Source Contribution Club (OSCC)** through AnitaB.org. What began as curiosity turned into a meaningful journey that taught me valuable lessons, connected me with a global community, and ultimately inspired me to encourage others to take the first step into open source.

## Tackling Tricky Issues: A Learning Moment

One of the most memorable moments from my OSCC journey involved a Pandas issue that had been open for several years. I spent hours attempting to fix it, only to find new test failures with each solution. It was frustrating, and I wondered if I would ever succeed. During one of our OSCC sessions, a mentor helped me see why the issue had remained unresolved for so long. I learned an invaluable lesson: **start with more recent issues that have active discussions**. This guidance not only saved time but also boosted my confidence to continue contributing.
